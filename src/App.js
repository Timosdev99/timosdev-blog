<h1>Hey, Timosdev Here</h1>
<p>I love coding, physics and math  

  <br/>
  As a backend developer, my world revolves around the intricate dance of data and logic that powers the digital experiences we interact with daily. But my passion for technology doesn't stop at writing efficient code or optimizing database queries. I'm on a quest to understand the very fabric of computation itself.
